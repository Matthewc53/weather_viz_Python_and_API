In this project, I used a python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to visualize the weather for 500 cities picked at random using numpy. I then did an API call to return the data and used seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data.

I plotted the following relationships:
  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
